        <h2>Project Concept</h2>
        <p>The concept this project was and is built upon the idea of education. Rapa Nui is an island many people know of but likely by the name of Easter Island instead, iconic for its Moai statues which have often been lauded as a mystery to be solved or in awe of. While the statues and the whole island are awe inspiring, it is the duty of educators to dispell myths and reveal the truth of the world when it becomes learned. For that purpose, this project intends to create an interactive map to teach people about the history of Rapa Nui, its people, and the statues that have long captivated imaginations and curiosity over the world.</p>
